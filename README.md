# RISC-V NTT
The objective of this project is to design and implement an accelerated Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) operation integrated with RISC-V through custom ISA extensions on an FPGA. The goal is to significantly enhance the performance of NTT, which is a critical and time-consuming operation in many cryptographic protocols and proof-generation processes.
